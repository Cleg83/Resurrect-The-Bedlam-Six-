Welcome,

This is a page dedicated to bringing back the greatest band you've probably never heard of.................Louis Barabbas & THe Bedlam Six.

Who are they and What do they sound like? 

These may well be questions you are asking yourself, so it's just as well you have found yourself here.

This site aims to answer those questions (and more) by showcasing the band's music, videos and various photographs (some posed, some action shots from the stage) and make you care about a band who never reached the dizzy heights they were (according to some very generous reviewers), destined for.
